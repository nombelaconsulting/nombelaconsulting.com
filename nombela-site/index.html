    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Nombela Consulting is a South African-based advisory firm that helps purpose-driven organisations align financial clarity with sustainable impact. Founded by Ndumiso Ngwabi, CA(SA), our firm blends deep expertise in accounting, ESG strategy, and social impact to deliver practical, values-led solutions. With global audit experience from firms like Deloitte Africa, PwC LLP in New York, and BDO LLP in London, we understand the highest standards of financial governance. Our mission is to make that expertise accessible—whether you’re a growing SME, a nonprofit, or a corporate shifting toward ESG integration. We believe finance should serve more than just the bottom line—it should enable transparency, inclusion, and long-term resilience.</p>
